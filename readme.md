# Hospital Transparency Repo
Following CMS' mandate for hospitals and payors to post files (hospital transparency and transparency in payor files)
that show standard charges, the web was innundated with files that begged more questions than they answered.
These files were often cumbersome, resourse intensive to read, and not standardized - in essence, nearly impossible for 
the lay-public to open and understand. This goes against the intended purpose for these files. 

The files in this repo contain functions (eventually classes and methods) that aim to help audiences open payor and hospital transparency files to understand 
the prices that hospitals and payors are charging. 

# Use 
Please feel free to use these functions and cite them when applicable. Further, feel free to add pull requests to improve these functions/methods.
